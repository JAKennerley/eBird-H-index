# eBird H-index
A short R script to calculate one's eBird H-index (eb-index), as inspired by [Joe Parham](https://twitter.com/Joeparham19/status/1646945089938137102).

The eb-index is the maximum value of 'H' such that given an ebirder has submitted at least 'H' checklists, at least 'H' species were observed on each checklist.
